## Currently Supported Cases

### 1. Basic Package Updates

**Scenario**: A package has a newer version available that is compatible with all current dependencies.

**Example**:
- Installed: `vendor/package:1.2.0`
- Latest: `vendor/package:1.3.0`
- Result: ✅ Update suggested

**Handling**: The system compares installed version with latest version and suggests update if newer.

---

### 2. Dependent Package Constraint Conflicts

**Scenario**: A package update is blocked because another installed package requires an older version.

**Example**:
- Trying to update: `rector/rector:2.3.1`
- Blocked by: `lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle` requires `rector/rector ^1.2`
- Result: ⚠️ System checks if `lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle` has a newer version that supports `rector/rector:2.3.1`
  - If newer compatible version found: ✅ Suggests updating both packages together
  - If not found: ❌ Update filtered with clear message: `lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle requires rector/rector ^1.2`

**Handling**: 
- The system checks `composer.lock` for all packages that depend on the target package
- Verifies if the proposed version satisfies all dependent constraints
- **NEW**: If not satisfied, automatically checks if dependent packages have newer versions that support the proposed update
- If compatible dependent version found, suggests updating both packages together
- If not found, the update is filtered and the conflicting dependent is reported
- Example: When `zircote/swagger-php:6.0.2` conflicts with `nelmio/api-doc-bundle` requiring `^4.11.1 || ^5.0`, the system checks if `nelmio/api-doc-bundle:6.0.0` exists and requires `zircote/swagger-php:^6.0`
  - If found: Suggests `composer require --with-all-dependencies zircote/swagger-php:6.0.2 nelmio/api-doc-bundle:6.0.0`

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported with automatic dependent package update detection

---

### 3. Package Requirement Conflicts

**Scenario**: A package update requires a newer version of a transitive dependency that is not installed or is outdated.

**Example**:
- Trying to update: `scheb/2fa-google-authenticator:8.2.0`
- Requires: `spomky-labs/otphp:^11.4`
- Installed: `spomky-labs/otphp:11.3.0`
- Result: ⚠️ Update filtered, transitive dependency suggested

**Handling**:
- The system checks all requirements of the proposed package version
- Verifies if installed versions satisfy those requirements
- If not satisfied, suggests updating the transitive dependency
- Generates a command that includes both packages

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported with transitive dependency suggestions

---

### 4. Self-Version Constraints

**Scenario**: A package requires another package at the exact same version (e.g., `self.version` constraint).

**Example**:
- Trying to update: `scheb/2fa-google-authenticator:8.2.0`
- Requires: `scheb/2fa-bundle: self.version` (means version 8.2.0)
- Installed: `scheb/2fa-bundle:8.1.0`
- Result: ⚠️ Update filtered, suggests updating `scheb/2fa-bundle:8.2.0` together

**Handling**:
- Detects `self.version` or `@self` constraints
- Extracts the required version from the proposing package version
- Suggests updating the related package to match the version
- Includes both packages in the same update command

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

---

### 5. Framework Version Constraints

**Scenario**: A package update would exceed the framework version constraint (e.g., Symfony 7.4.* constraint).

**Example**:
- Framework constraint: `symfony:7.4.*`
- Trying to update: `symfony/console:8.0.0`
- Result: ✅ Update limited to `symfony/console:7.4.x` (latest in 7.4.* range)

**Handling**:
- Detects framework constraints from `composer.json` (`extra.symfony.require`) or installed core packages
- Limits package updates to versions compatible with the framework constraint
- Supported frameworks: Symfony, Laravel, Yii, CakePHP, Laminas, CodeIgniter, Slim

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported for major frameworks

---

### 6. Ignored Packages

**Scenario**: User explicitly ignores certain packages from updates via configuration.

**Example**:
```yaml
ignore:
  - doctrine/orm
  - symfony/security-bundle
```

**Handling**:
- Packages in the `ignore` list are excluded from update suggestions
- Still shown in output with available versions for information
- Configuration supports both `.yaml` and `.yml` extensions

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

---

### 7. Force-Included Packages

**Scenario**: User wants to force-include packages even if they are in the ignore list.

**Example**:
```yaml
ignore:
  - symfony/*
include:
  - symfony/security-bundle  # Override ignore for this specific package
```

**Handling**:
- `include` section has priority over `ignore` section
- Allows fine-grained control: ignore framework packages but include specific ones

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

---

### 8. Production vs Development Dependencies

**Scenario**: Separating production and development dependency updates.

**Example**:
- Production: `symfony/console:7.4.0`
- Development: `phpunit/phpunit:12.5.5`

**Handling**:
- Automatically categorizes packages as `(prod)` or `(dev)`
- Generates separate commands: `composer require` vs `composer require --dev`
- Maintains proper dependency separation

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

---

### 9. Version Comparison to Avoid Unnecessary Updates

**Scenario**: Preventing suggestions for packages already at or above the target version.

**Example**:
- Installed: `vendor/package:2.0.0`
- Latest: `vendor/package:2.0.0` (or `1.9.0`)
- Result: ✅ No update suggested

**Handling**:
- Compares installed version with proposed version
- Skips if installed >= proposed version
- Only suggests actual updates

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

---

### 10. Multiple Transitive Dependencies

**Scenario**: A package update requires updating multiple transitive dependencies.

**Example**:
- Trying to update: `scheb/2fa-bundle:8.2.0`
- Requires: `scheb/2fa-email:8.2.0` (self.version)
- Requires: `spomky-labs/otphp:^11.4`
- Result: ⚠️ Suggests updating all three packages together

**Handling**:
- Collects all required transitive updates
- Groups them by production/dev
- Generates commands that include all related packages
- Ensures all dependencies are updated together

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

---

### 14. Conflict Impact Analysis

**Scenario**: Analyzing the impact of updating packages when conflicts are detected (which packages would be affected).

**Example**:
- Updating `package-a` to `2.0` conflicts with `dependency-x` which requires `^1.5`
- The analysis shows that `dependent-package-1` and `dependent-package-2` would be affected
- Transitive packages that depend on these affected packages are also identified

**Handling**:
- Automatically analyzes which packages would be affected by updating a conflicting package
- Shows direct affected packages (packages that directly depend on the conflicting package)
- Shows transitive affected packages (packages that depend on directly affected packages)
- Displays impact analysis in output with clear formatting
- Provides complete dependency chain visualization

**Implementation Details**:
- Uses `ImpactAnalyzer::analyzeImpact()` to analyze impact when conflicts are detected
- Recursively checks transitive dependencies (up to 5 levels deep to prevent infinite loops)
- Format: `📊 Impact analysis: Updating package-a to 2.0 would affect: - dependent-package-1 (requires package-a:^1.5)`
- Integrated into conflict detection flow

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

---

## Partially Supported Cases

### 11. Wildcard Version Constraints

**Scenario**: Package versions with wildcards (e.g., `7.4.*`, `^8.0`, `~1.2`).

**Example**:
- Framework constraint: `symfony:7.4.*`
- Latest version: `symfony/console:7.4.3`

**Handling**:
- ✅ Framework constraints with wildcards are supported
- ✅ **Dependency checking now supports wildcard constraints** (`*`, `^`, `~`)
- ✅ Full dependency conflict detection for wildcard constraints using `versionSatisfiesConstraint`

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported

---

## Not Yet Supported Cases

The following scenarios are **documented but not yet implemented**. When these cases occur, the tool will:

- ❌ **Filter packages** showing conflict messages
- ❌ **Not provide automatic solutions** - Requires manual intervention from the user  
- ⚠️ **Limited guidance** - User must analyze and resolve conflicts manually

Each case below explains what happens currently, what's missing, and what manual steps the user must take.

### 12. Circular Dependency Conflicts

**Scenario**: Package A requires Package B at version X, while Package B requires Package A at version Y.

**Example**:
- `vendor/package-a:2.0` requires `vendor/package-b:^1.5`
- `vendor/package-b:1.6` requires `vendor/package-a:^2.1`
- Result: ❌ **No solution provided** - Both packages filtered separately without recognizing the circular dependency

**Current Behavior**: 
- Each package would be filtered individually with separate conflict messages
- ❌ No recognition of the circular nature of the conflict
- ❌ No suggestion to update both packages together
- ❌ No strategy to break the circular dependency

**What's Needed**: 
- Detection of circular dependencies
- Resolution strategies (update both together, or suggest breaking the circular dependency)
- Warning messages explaining the circular nature

**Priority**: Medium

**Current Solution**: Manual intervention required - user must analyze conflicts and update packages manually

---

### 13. Cascading Conflict Chains

**Scenario**: A conflict chain where Package A → B → C → D, and updating D requires updating C, B, and A.

**Example**:
- Update `package-d:4.0` requires `package-c:^3.0`
- Update `package-c:3.0` requires `package-b:^2.0`
- Update `package-b:2.0` requires `package-a:^1.5`
- All are currently at older versions

**Current Behavior**: 
- ✅ Transitive dependencies are suggested (one level deep)
- ⚠️ **Partial solution** - Only immediate transitive dependencies are suggested
- ❌ No automatic detection of the full chain depth (A → B → C → D)
- ❌ No optimization to update all packages in the chain at once
- ❌ No visualization of the complete dependency chain

**What's Needed**:
- Recursive traversal to detect full dependency chains
- Optimized command generation for multi-level chains
- Better visualization of dependency chains

**Priority**: Medium-High

**Current Solution**: User must manually execute commands multiple times, one level at a time

---

### 14. Abandoned Package Conflicts

**Scenario**: A package is abandoned and conflicts with newer versions of dependencies, but no compatible version exists.

**Example**:
- `abandoned/package:1.0.0` requires `old/dependency:^2.0`
- `old/dependency` is at version 5.0.0, no longer supports ^2.0
- `abandoned/package` has no newer version

**Current Behavior**: 
- ✅ **Detection implemented** - Package abandonment status is detected via Packagist API
- ✅ **Warning shown** - Update is filtered with conflict message AND abandoned warning
- ✅ **Replacement suggested** - If Packagist provides a replacement, it's shown in the warning
- ⚠️ **Partial solution** - Warning is shown but no automatic migration path
- ❌ No migration path recommendations beyond replacement suggestion

**Implementation Details**:
- Uses Packagist API (`packagist.org/packages/{package}.json`) to check `abandoned` field
- Warning format: `(⚠️ Package is abandoned, replaced by: new-package/name)` if replacement exists
- Warning format: `(⚠️ Package is abandoned)` if no replacement is specified
- Integrated into conflict detection flow

**What's Still Needed**:
- Migration path recommendations (step-by-step guide)
- Automated replacement suggestions (beyond Packagist's replacement field)
- Alternative package discovery

**Priority**: Low-Medium (Partially implemented ✅)

**Current Solution**: ✅ Automatic detection and warning - user can see replacement package if available

---

### 15. Repository-Specific Conflicts

**Scenario**: Conflicts that only exist in private repositories or specific repository configurations.

**Current Behavior**: 
- ✅ Basic support for any Composer repository
- ❌ **No solution provided** - Conflicts from repository priorities are not detected
- ❌ No special handling for repository-specific constraints
- ❌ No detection of repository priority conflicts

**What's Needed**:
- Better support for repository-specific version constraints
- Detection of conflicts between repositories
- Suggestions when conflicts might be resolved by adjusting repository priorities

**Priority**: Low

**Current Solution**: Manual intervention - user must adjust repository priorities in `composer.json`

---

### 16. Batch Update Optimization

**Scenario**: Optimizing multiple package updates to minimize dependency resolution steps.

**Example**:
- 10 packages need updates
- Some updates depend on others
- Optimal strategy: group updates to minimize resolver runs

**Current Behavior**: 
- ✅ Suggests all compatible updates together (basic grouping)
- ⚠️ **Suboptimal solution** - All packages in one command may be inefficient
- ❌ No optimization for update order
- ❌ No batching strategy to minimize resolver calls
- ❌ No analysis of dependency graph to optimize execution

**What's Needed**:
- Dependency graph analysis
- Optimal update ordering algorithm
- Batching strategy to group updates efficiently

**Priority**: Medium

**Current Solution**: Works but may be slower - all packages updated in one command regardless of dependencies

---

### 17. Pre-Installation Conflict Prediction

**Scenario**: Predicting conflicts before actually running `composer require`, using dry-run or simulation.

**Current Behavior**: 
- ✅ Uses `composer show` to check package requirements (good approximation)
- ⚠️ **Partial solution** - May miss edge cases that only appear during actual resolution
- ❌ No actual dry-run of `composer require`
- ❌ Some conflicts may only be detected when Composer actually resolves dependencies
- ❌ False positives/negatives possible

**What's Needed**:
- Integration with Composer's dependency resolver
- Dry-run simulation of updates (`composer require --dry-run`)
- More accurate conflict prediction

**Priority**: High (would improve accuracy significantly)

**Current Solution**: Good approximation but not 100% accurate - some conflicts may only appear during actual `composer require`

---

### 18. Alternative Package Suggestions

**Scenario**: When a package update is blocked by conflicts, suggest alternative packages that might work.

**Example**:
- `package-a:2.0` conflicts with `dependency-x`
- Alternative `package-b:2.0` might work with `dependency-x`

**Current Behavior**: 
- ✅ **Alternative package detection** - **Now implemented**
  - Automatically searches for alternative packages when conflicts exist
  - Uses Packagist API to find similar packages based on keywords
  - Shows alternatives when packages are abandoned without replacement
  - Shows alternatives when no fallback version is available
  - Example: `💡 Alternative packages: - new-package/name (recommended replacement) - alternative/pkg (similar functionality)`
- ✅ Migration path suggestions via Packagist API search
- ✅ Package discovery functionality

**Implementation Details**:
- `AlternativePackageFinder::findAlternatives()` function searches for alternatives
- Checks abandoned status first (if abandoned with replacement, shows replacement)
- Searches Packagist for similar packages using keywords extracted from package name
- Returns top 3 most relevant alternatives
- Output includes alternative packages section when available

**What's Still Needed**:
- Cost-benefit analysis of alternatives
- Version compatibility checking for alternatives
- Migration guide generation

**Priority**: Low (Partially implemented ✅)

**Current Solution**: ✅ Alternative packages are automatically suggested when conflicts exist

---

### 19. Conflict Resolution Strategies

**Scenario**: Providing multiple resolution strategies when conflicts are detected.

**Example**:
- Conflict: `package-a:2.0` conflicts with `dependency-x:1.0`
- Strategy 1: Update `dependency-x` to `2.0` (if compatible) ✅ Supported
- Strategy 2: Keep `package-a:1.9` (if compatible with `dependency-x:1.0`) ✅ **Now supported**
- Strategy 3: Remove `dependency-x` (if not critical) ❌ Not supported

**Current Behavior**: 
- ✅ Suggests transitive dependency updates (Strategy 1) - **Implemented**
- ✅ **Dependent package update detection (Strategy 1b)** - **Now implemented**
  - When a package conflicts with a dependent package, automatically checks if the dependent package has a newer version that supports the proposed update
  - If found, suggests updating both packages together
  - Example: `composer require --with-all-dependencies package-a:2.0 dependent-package:3.0`
- ✅ **Fallback version suggestions (Strategy 2)** - **Implemented**
  - Automatically searches for compatible older versions when primary update conflicts
  - Verifies fallback versions satisfy all conflicting dependencies
  - Shows "Alternative solutions" section in output
  - Example: `💡 Alternative solutions: - package-a:1.9.5 (compatible with conflicting dependencies)`
- ❌ No dependency removal suggestions (Strategy 3)
- ⚠️ **Partial implementation** - Three strategies available (transitive updates, dependent updates, fallback versions), removal suggestions still missing

**Implementation Details**:
- `VersionResolver::findCompatibleDependentVersions()` searches for newer versions of conflicting dependent packages
  - Checks if dependent packages have versions that support the proposed update
  - If found, adds them to transitive updates to be included in the same command
- `findFallbackVersion()` function searches for compatible older versions
- Verifies fallback satisfies all conflicting constraints
- Verifies fallback's own requirements don't conflict with installed packages
- Output includes both dependent updates and fallback suggestions when available

**What's Still Needed**:
- Dependency removal suggestions (Strategy 3)
- Multiple strategy comparison
- User choice of preferred strategy

**Priority**: Medium-High (Partially implemented ✅)

**Current Solution**: ✅ Three strategies available - transitive updates, dependent package updates, and fallback versions

---

## Case #20: Edge Cases - No Compatible Versions Available

**Scenario**: A package update conflicts with dependent packages, but no compatible versions of the dependent packages exist that support the proposed update.

**Example Cases**:
1. `zircote/swagger-php:6.0.2` conflicts with `nelmio/api-doc-bundle` requiring `^4.11.1 || ^5.0`
   - No version of `nelmio/api-doc-bundle` exists that supports `zircote/swagger-php:^6.0`
   - All available versions (up to 5.9.2) require `^4.11.1 || ^5.0`

2. `phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock:6.0.1` conflicts with `a2lix/auto-form-bundle:1.0.0` requiring `^5.6`
   - No version of `a2lix/auto-form-bundle` exists that supports `phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock:^6.0`
   - Latest version (1.0.0) requires `^5.6`

**Current Behavior**:
- ✅ System automatically searches for compatible versions of dependent packages
- ✅ System checks all available versions of conflicting dependents
- ✅ If no compatible versions found, explains why no automatic solution is available
- ✅ Suggests fallback versions of the original package (if available)
- ✅ Suggests alternative packages (if available)
- ✅ Provides maintainer contact information for manual resolution

**What Happens**:
1. System detects conflict with dependent package
2. System searches for newer versions of dependent package that support the proposed update
3. If no compatible versions found:
   - Package is filtered (not included in update commands)
   - Clear explanation is shown: "No compatible version of {dependent-package} found that supports {package}:{version}"
   - Fallback version suggestions are shown (if available)
   - Alternative package suggestions are shown (if available)
   - Maintainer contact information is provided (if available)

**Output Example**:
```
⚠️  Filtered by dependency conflicts:
     - zircote/swagger-php:6.0.2 (prod) (conflicts with 1 package: nelmio/api-doc-bundle requires zircote/swagger-php ^4.11.1 || ^5.0)
     ℹ️  No compatible version of nelmio/api-doc-bundle found that supports zircote/swagger-php:6.0.2
     ℹ️  All available versions of nelmio/api-doc-bundle require zircote/swagger-php:^4.11.1 || ^5.0

💡 Alternative solutions:
     - zircote/swagger-php:5.7.8 (compatible with conflicting dependencies)

💡 Alternative packages:
     - [alternative suggestions if available]

📧 Contact maintainers:
     - [maintainer contact information if available]
```

**Why This Happens**:
- Package maintainers haven't released versions that support the newer dependency versions yet
- Breaking changes in the dependency require significant updates to the dependent package
- Dependent package may be abandoned or in maintenance mode
- Version compatibility matrix hasn't been updated by maintainers

**What You Can Do**:
1. **Use fallback versions**: Use the suggested fallback version of the original package (e.g., `zircote/swagger-php:5.7.8` instead of `6.0.2`)
2. **Wait for updates**: Monitor the dependent package for new releases that support the newer version
3. **Contact maintainers**: Use the provided contact information to request compatibility updates
4. **Consider alternatives**: Evaluate alternative packages that may have better compatibility
5. **Manual resolution**: Manually update dependencies if you have the resources to handle potential breaking changes

**Status**: ✅ Fully supported with clear explanations and actionable suggestions

**Priority**: High (User experience improvement)

## Manual Intervention: Contacting Package Maintainers

Some scenarios **cannot be resolved automatically** and require **contacting package maintainers** to request dependency updates:

### When Manual Contact is Required

1. **Incompatible Version Requirements**
   - Two packages require incompatible versions of the same dependency
   - Example: Package A requires `dependency-x:^1.0`, Package B requires `dependency-x:^2.0`
   - No version satisfies both constraints
   - **Action**: Contact maintainer(s) of Package A or B to update their version constraints

2. **Stale Packages**
   - Package hasn't been updated in >2 years
   - Requires very old dependencies (e.g., Symfony 2.x when 6.x is available)
   - **Action**: Contact maintainer to request dependency updates or find alternative package

3. **Abandoned Packages Without Replacement**
   - Package is marked as abandoned
   - No replacement package is suggested
   - **Action**: Contact original maintainer or search for community fork

4. **Conflicting Major Versions**
   - Constraints on different major versions with no overlap
   - Example: Package A allows `^1.0|^2.0`, Package B requires `^3.0`
   - **Action**: Contact maintainer(s) to update version constraints

**Current Behavior**: 
- ✅ **Maintainer contact suggestions** - **Now implemented**
  - Automatically detects scenarios where manual intervention is needed
  - Extracts maintainer information from Packagist API (name, email, homepage)
  - Generates repository issue URLs for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
  - Detects stale packages (>2 years without updates)
  - Provides actionable steps for manual resolution
  - Example: `⚠️ No automatic solution available - Contact package maintainer(s): John Doe (john@example.com)`
- ✅ Automatic detection of incompatible constraints and major version conflicts
- ✅ Stale package warnings with actionable suggestions

**Implementation Details**:
- `MaintainerContactFinder::getMaintainerInfo()` function extracts maintainer information
- `MaintainerContactFinder::shouldSuggestContact()` determines when to suggest contact
- `MaintainerContactFinder::generateIssueUrl()` creates repository issue URLs
- Output includes maintainer contact section when no automatic solution is available
