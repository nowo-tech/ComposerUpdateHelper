# Packages to ignore during update
# Each line is a package name (e.g.: vendor/package)
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
#
# Ignored packages will still be displayed in the output with their available versions,
# but won't be included in the composer require commands.
#
# Common packages to ignore:
# - Framework core packages (usually updated separately)
# - Packages with breaking changes between major versions
# - Packages that require manual migration steps
#
# Examples (uncomment the ones you want to ignore):
# doctrine/orm
# doctrine/doctrine-bundle
# doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle
# symfony/security-bundle
# laravel/framework
# yiisoft/yii2
# cakephp/cakephp
# codeigniter4/framework
# slim/slim
