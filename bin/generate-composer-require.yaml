# ⚠️  WARNING: i18n feature is currently in DEVELOPMENT MODE
#language: es

# Enable detailed dependency compatibility checking
# When enabled (true), the tool will check if proposed package versions are compatible
# with currently installed dependencies, preventing conflicts before they occur.
# This feature is production-ready and recommended for all users.
# When disabled (false), the tool will suggest all available updates without checking
# dependency compatibility (faster but may suggest incompatible updates).
# Default: true
# Can be overridden with command line arguments
check-dependencies: true

# Show release information by default
# When enabled (true), shows release summary with links to GitHub releases and changelogs.
# When disabled (false), no API calls are made for release information (faster execution).
# Default: false
# Can be overridden with --release-info, --release-detail, or --no-release-info
show-release-info: false

# Show full release changelog by default
# When enabled (true), shows full changelog for each package (implies show-release-info).
# When disabled (false), only shows release summary if show-release-info is enabled.
# Default: false
# Can be overridden with --release-detail or --no-release-info
show-release-detail: false

# Show impact analysis for conflicting packages by default
# When enabled (true), shows which packages would be affected by updating conflicting packages.
# When disabled (false), impact analysis is not shown (reduces output verbosity).
# Default: false
# Can be overridden with --show-impact, --impact, or --save-impact
show-impact-analysis: false

# Save impact analysis to file by default
# When enabled (true), saves impact analysis to composer-update-impact.txt (implies show-impact-analysis).
# When disabled (false), impact analysis is only shown in output if show-impact-analysis is enabled.
# Default: false
# Can be overridden with --save-impact
save-impact-to-file: false

# Verbose output by default
# When enabled (true), shows detailed information including configuration files and packages.
# When disabled (false), shows only essential information.
# Default: false
# Can be overridden with -v, --verbose, or --debug
verbose: false

# Debug mode by default
# When enabled (true), shows very detailed debug information including file paths and parsing details.
# When disabled (false), debug information is not shown.
# Default: false
# Can be overridden with --debug
debug: false

# Note: The following features are automatically enabled when check-dependencies is true:
# - Abandoned Package Detection: Automatically detects and warns about abandoned packages
#   when they are filtered due to conflicts. Shows replacement package if available.
# - Fallback Version Suggestions: When a package update conflicts with dependencies,
#   the tool automatically searches for compatible older versions that satisfy all
#   conflicting constraints and shows them as "Alternative solutions".
# These features require no configuration and work automatically.

# List of packages to ignore during update
# Ignored packages will still be displayed in the output with their available versions,
# but won't be included in the composer require commands.
#
# IMPORTANT: Only uncommented packages are read. Lines starting with # are ignored.
# To ignore a package, remove the # and space before the dash:
#   - package/name  ✅ This will be read and ignored
#   # - package/name  ❌ This is a comment and will NOT be read

# The include section has priority over the ignore section.
#
# IMPORTANT: Only uncommented packages are read. Lines starting with # are ignored.
# To force include a package, remove the # and space before the dash:
