# ⚠️  WARNING: i18n feature is currently in DEVELOPMENT MODE
#language: es

# Enable detailed dependency compatibility checking
# When enabled (true), the tool will check if proposed package versions are compatible
# with currently installed dependencies, preventing conflicts before they occur.
# This feature is production-ready and recommended for all users.
# When disabled (false), the tool will suggest all available updates without checking
# dependency compatibility (faster but may suggest incompatible updates).
# Default: true
check-dependencies: true

# Note: The following features are automatically enabled when check-dependencies is true:
# - Abandoned Package Detection: Automatically detects and warns about abandoned packages
#   when they are filtered due to conflicts. Shows replacement package if available.
# - Fallback Version Suggestions: When a package update conflicts with dependencies,
#   the tool automatically searches for compatible older versions that satisfy all
#   conflicting constraints and shows them as "Alternative solutions".
# These features require no configuration and work automatically.

# List of packages to ignore during update
# Ignored packages will still be displayed in the output with their available versions,
# but won't be included in the composer require commands.

#   - package/name  ✅ This will be read and ignored
