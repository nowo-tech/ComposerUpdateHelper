# Composer Update Helper Configuration
# Configuration file for ignored and included packages during composer update suggestions

# Enable detailed dependency compatibility checking
# ⚠️  WARNING: This feature is currently in DEVELOPMENT MODE and is still being reviewed and refined.
# While functional, it may not catch all edge cases and should be used with caution in production environments.
# When enabled (true), the tool will check if proposed package versions are compatible
# with currently installed dependencies, preventing conflicts before they occur.
# When disabled (false), the tool will suggest all available updates without checking
# dependency compatibility (faster but may suggest incompatible updates).
# Default: true
check-dependencies: true
