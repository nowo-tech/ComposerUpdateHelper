EXAMPLES:
    %s                                    # Show suggested commands (no release info by default)
    %s --run                              # Execute suggested commands
    %s --release-info                     # Show release information summary
    %s --release-detail                   # Show full changelogs (implies --release-info)
    %s --show-impact                      # Show impact analysis for conflicting packages
    %s --save-impact                      # Save impact analysis to file
    %s --verbose                           # Show verbose output with configuration details
    %s --debug                             # Show detailed debug information
    %s --run --release-detail             # Execute and show full changelogs
    %s --verbose --release-info # Verbose with release info
    %s --show-impact --verbose            # Show impact analysis with verbose output
    %s --save-impact --verbose            # Save impact analysis to file with verbose output
    %s --debug                  # Debug mode (very detailed)

FRAMEWORK SUPPORT:
    The script automatically respects framework version constraints:
    - Symfony: respects "extra.symfony.require" constraint
    - Laravel: respects laravel/framework major.minor version
    - Yii: respects yiisoft/yii2 major.minor version
    - CakePHP: respects cakephp/cakephp major.minor version
    - Laminas: respects laminas/* major.minor versions
    - CodeIgniter: respects codeigniter4/framework major.minor version
    - Slim: respects slim/slim major.minor version

IGNORED PACKAGES:
    Packages listed in generate-composer-require.yaml or .yml will be skipped.
    The script searches for configuration files in the current directory (where composer.json is located).
    Old format (generate-composer-require.ignore.txt) is still supported for backward compatibility.
    Comments starting with # are ignored.

RELEASE INFORMATION:
    By default, release information is NOT shown (no API calls are made).
    Use --release-info to show a summary with:
    - Package name
    - Release URL
    - Changelog URL

    Use --release-detail to see the full release changelog.
    Use --no-release-info to explicitly skip release information (default behavior).

CONFLICT RESOLUTION FEATURES:
    The script automatically handles various dependency conflict scenarios:

    1. Dependent Package Update Detection:
       - When a package update conflicts with a dependent package, the system
         automatically checks if the dependent package has a newer version that
         supports the proposed update.
       - If found, both packages are included in the same update command.
       - Example: If updating zircote/swagger-php:6.0.2 conflicts with
         nelmio/api-doc-bundle requiring ^5.0, the system checks if
         nelmio/api-doc-bundle:6.0.0 exists and supports ^6.0.

    2. Grouped Package Installation:
       - When multiple packages are filtered by conflicts, the system suggests
         installing them together in a single command.
       - Sometimes Composer can resolve conflicts better when multiple packages
         are installed simultaneously.
       - The system also includes packages that passed dependency checks in
         grouped commands, as installing everything together can help resolve
         conflicts.

    3. Compatible Installed Package Detection:
       - When grouping packages, the system checks if installed packages need
         updates to support the grouped packages.
       - If compatible newer versions are found, they are automatically included
         in the grouped command.

    4. Maintainer Contact Suggestions:
       - When no automatic solution is available, the system identifies packages
         that need updates from their maintainers.
       - Provides maintainer contact information (email, repository URL) and
         suggests contacting them to request support for required versions.

    5. Transitive Dependency Updates:
       - Automatically detects when transitive dependencies need updates to
         resolve conflicts.
       - Suggests updating these dependencies first, then retrying the main update.

    6. Fallback Versions:
       - When the latest version causes conflicts, searches for compatible
         older versions that don't have conflicts.

    7. Alternative Package Suggestions:
       - For abandoned packages or when no compatible versions exist, suggests
         alternative packages with similar functionality.

    8. Edge Cases Documentation:
       - When no automatic solution is available, provides clear explanations
         of why updates are filtered and what can be done about it.

OUTPUT FEATURES:
    - Commands are displayed with a 📋 icon for easy copying
    - Clickable commands in modern terminals (OSC 8 hyperlink support)
    - Clear visual indicators for different types of packages (prod/dev)
    - Detailed conflict information showing which packages cause conflicts
    - Maintainer contact information when manual intervention is needed
